### Why should you have a multilingual website?

It’s easy to forget all about other languages when setting up your online business! With the resources needed to put together a new website, multilingual capabilities are very commonly ignored, as the process of getting multiple translations can get complicated and expensive. But ignoring the importance of being multilingual can be a costly mistake: unlocking the possibility for visitors to read and interact in their own language means you’ll be significantly widening your reach, increasing your chances of business success!

This is why it’s important to think of ways to offer translations in more languages: multilingual websites naturally rank in more countries and attract more potential customers. Your visitors will also feel like you are significantly more localized by speaking to them in a language they easily understand!

But how about the cost and headache to set up a proper multilingual website offering high quality translations? This is where Weglot can make it easy: with a simple way to unlock multilingual capabilities swiftly, your website can go from targeted towards a single language to multilingual in an easy, affordable manner!

"Using Weglot for translations, it is easy to find content with the required phrase, changes are visible online in real time. Weglot is my translation library – finally, no additional files are needed. I appreciate the workflow and the intuitive navigation."
**Joanna Kruszewska, Marketing Assistant – Social Media and Translations, Olympus Cameras**

= Can I add translated images and videos? =

To do this, you can simply upload your other translated image into your WordPress gallery.

Yes, you can translate your URL slugs with Weglot. This is useful if you’d like an extra layer of localization.

= Can I use Weglot Translate on more than one website? =

= Does Weglot Translate provide support? =

Yes, and our users love us for it; just check out our reviews! The Weglot Translate team offers support for all users, with priority accorded to premium members. Be sure to check out our [Help center](https://support.weglot.com/). Post a topic on the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weglot/), or email us at support@weglot.com if you have any questions.


= Can I use subdomains for each language? =

It's not currently possible to use several subdomains on WordPress with Weglot Translate such as de.website.com. However, Weglot uses subdirectories in your URL to separate all the multilingual versions of your website.

For example, if your website is website.com, then the French version would be website.com/fr/, same for the German version website.com/de/, and so on. This is repeated for each version of your new multilingual website. A unique URL is therefore created for each version of your multilingual web page, which is important for your SEO.


= What is the quality of Weglot’s translations? =

Weglot offers the same high quality of automatic translations throughout all plans, from free to enterprise. We use leading providers like DeepL, Google Translate, and Microsoft Translator to bring you the most accurate translations for your language pairs. You can also refine these translations, have team members edit them, or professionally translate them throughout all plans.
